## UI Playground 

Welcome to my **UI Playground**!  This is a fun little project where I’m just kicking back and exploring some cool UI libraries, playing around with **Magic UI**, **Acerenity UI**, and whatever else catches my eye! 

## What’s going on here?

Nothing too serious! I’m:

- Experimenting with awesome UI libraries like Magic UI & Acerenity UI.  
- Building random components, layouts, and anything fun that pops into my head.
- Learning how to customize and theme components to make them pop! 

## Libraries I’m playing with

Here’s what I’m using:

- **[Magic UI](https://magicui.design/a)**: A magical UI kit that’s a delight to use. 
- **[Acerenity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)**: A smooth and serene UI library that makes building interfaces a breeze. 

## Installation

Wanna join the fun? Here’s how to get started:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Zkyarpan/Animations.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What you’ll see

Expect to find:

- **Cool buttons** 🔘  
- **Sleek modals** 📦  
- **Stylish cards** 💳  
- **Custom animations** 🎞️  

And probably some wild UI experiments that I thought were a good idea at the time. 

## Notes

This repo is purely for fun. There might be random commits at random hours, so don’t expect anything too polished! I’m just here to explore and learn. 


Happy Coding! 🖥️
